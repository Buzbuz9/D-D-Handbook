		<p>Once you have finished creating your character you are ready to play. For the game itself you will need others to play with. You can learn more about
		finding other duengons and dragons(dnd) players under the Finding Players section. Once you have found a group you are ready to go. Now dnd has a lot of rules that I am going to explain
		the basics of, but remember that all decisions, in the end, are up to the DM. And most DMs are willing to bend rules here and there so that it can be more fun.</p>
		<h2>Starting a Campaign</h2>
			<p>The first real step to starting dnd is joining a campaign. This can be super intimidating especially if you are joining a group that has already been playing together
			for a while. Don't worry if it takes you a while to get used to your group. Every group is different, and has a different play style. Some groups are all about
			power and battle while others are all about goofing around trying to avoid battle and just role-playing through every situation. The first group I ever played
			with was very much into role-playing since they were the better half of the theater kids at my high school. It was hard for me to get used to because I was very much
			not an actress. After a few sessions I started to get into it and after a while I felt like I really change who I was when playing dnd. I used a different voice for my 
			character and tried to think through my problems like my character would. But my second group was very into battling and wanted to make the best team dynamic possible 
			so I learned how to strategize and work with the abilities my character had better. Dnd can be any type of game you want but it is almost always fun. I have sectioned
			off the most important part of the game and done my best to explain them below.</p>
			
			<hr></hr>
		<h2>Battle</h2>
			<h3>Starting a Battle</h3>
				<p>Starting a battle is usually pretty easy either you make a move to attack someone or something, or something you do triggers a battle. This is usually walking 
				somewhere your character "shouldn't" be. Like a secret base, gang territory. Or your character can do something to provoke someone to attack them, by being annoying or
				an rude. Either way you will know a battle has started when your DM says to roll for initiative. This means roll you d20, whoever rolls the highest gets to attack frist.
				If two characters tie then whoever has the higher dexterity score goes first. If those are equal too your DM will decide who goes first. </p>
			<h3>Turns</h3>
				<p>Every character engaged in the battle gets a turn. Once everyone takes their turn it is a round, rounds last 6 sec in-game time. There are several things you can do during a turn in dnd. 
				You can move the distance that is your speed, you can take an action, and if you have one you can take a bonus action. If you want to move farther than your speed you can 
				take the action dash and go double, but you won't be able to do any actions. The most common action is to attack an enemy, but you could also disengage and remove yourself
				from the battle or do something creative. In one campaign on mine we were fighting an enemy that was made out of mist, and for 5 rounds I was trying to catch him in my bag or 
				holding like sponge bob catches jellyfish. In a different campaign of mine I joined a bunch of zombie in the zombie edition of Hamlet instead of fighting them we became
				friends. Dnd is all about being creative and having fun. Once the battle ends you all leave initative and can act as frequently and in any order your DM allows.</p>
			<h3>Rolling</h3>
				<p>The most common and important thing you do in dnd is roll. This is what helps keeps the game fun and challenging. Your DM decides when and what type of roll
				or check you need to make to do a certain action or find something out. There are countless times when you will roll in dnd, but most of the time you will be rolling
				 a d20(that is the almost round 20 sided die from your set). You roll a d20 any time you do a check(to see if your character does something successfully), to attack,
				 to perform difficult actions, and the list practically never ends. The harder the action, check, or the tougher the opponent the higher the number your DM will set
				 for it to be a success. The base level is 11 and up is success and 10 or below is a failure just like making saving throws. But most of the time in battle you will have to 
				 beat(roll higher than) a 12 or 15. There are other things that factor into how you calculate your roll score. If it is an ability score add the number in the tiny circle
				 on your character sheet before saying to your DM. If it is a skill like stealth or animal handling, add/subtract the number next to it on the bottom left on your character sheet.
				 For battle you have to roll twice at least every turn. Some types of races, backgrounds, and abilities allow for more attacks. For the first roll you are seeing if your attack
				 will hit. You roll this with a d20, and you won't really know what number you are trying to beat. Add the attack bonus for the weapon you are using and your DM will tell you
				 if it hits or misses. If it hits then you roll for damage. This could be any of your dice common are d6 or d8, but I had a weapon that was a d4. You roll that dice and add
				 any bonuses and tell you DM the damage. This goes against your opponents HP. </p>
			<h3>Damage and Healing</h3>
				<p>Any attack that is aimed at you must also hit before your oppontent can deal damage. Your opponent will roll a d20 and add the modifier and will likely say something such as "18 to hit?"
				This means that after adding all bonuses there attack score was 18, you compare this to your armor class on your character sheet. If your armor is equal or higher than there roll the attack
				misses. If their roll is higher than your armor class then you will take the damage they roll for. Subtract that damage from your hp. If your hp goes to or below zero your character is unconous 
				and will need to make saving throws. However, if your characters hp is -(your total hp) that is instant death. If you make 3 successful saving throws(10+) then your character is stable, if you fail 
				3 saving throws(0-10) then that is death. Try not to stress if you die, most DM will help your party find a way to resurrect you. And healing is a great and key component to battle. Hp can be recovered in 
				battle by health potions or from healing spells. Also if you are in the process of making saving throws someone form your party can do a medical check to save you. </p>

		<h2>Traveling</h2>
			<p>Traveling is the journey your party takes either during or in between adventures. Be careful to have enough supplies before leaving town to travel. Your party will often get attacked or lost on the road.
			Plus you will cover all kinds of different terrain. You can perform actions while traveling like foraging or crafting but you will be unalert to danger.</p>
			<h3>Supplies</h3>
			<p>As you work through and complete quests and campaigns you will lose supplies and earn money. It is likely that your DM will give you opportunities to restock and spend money. 
			At the very least you have the money your character started out with. You will be able to stop at shops and purchase goods. Depending on how seriously your group takes the game you 
			may need to keep track of exact coinage. See the chart below for exchange rates, you also may need to keep track of the weight of your items. See page 143, 153, 154, and 157-159 in the <a href="dnd_handbook.pdf">PHB</a> for the extensive list 
			of costs and weight break down of different items. On page 159 you will see a table of the cost of services that shows you things you can request from npcs. Rember that dnd is all about creativity
			so don't feel like you have to limit yourself to this list. My party once paid a young lad to come with us just to play goofy tunes whenever we got into a fight. The sky is still the limit. One of the main
			expences you will face in dnd is lodging food and drink. Your party will often find itself in taverns and how good your lodging is will decide how well and fast your character recovers, but
			again it is more about the role-play than the stats. So try to pick what your character would. </p>

			<h3>Sleeping and Rests</h3>
			<p>Just like in real life most races need sleep. With the exception of Elves and half-elves who simply need to meditate for 4 hours. If your character goes too long with sleep 
			there will be consequences. Sleep and rests are the easiest ways to recover hp. Hp can also be recovered with healing potions and healing magic but those use supplies and spell slots 
			repectivly. A short rest is a period of downtime that is at least 1 hour long where you can spend hit dice to recover hp. This can be done occasionally while in contact with an enemy.
			A long rest is a period of extended downtime at least 8 hours long, when characters can sleep or perform light activities(up to the discretion of you DM). If it is interrupted it must start over 
			after a long rest your character regains all lost hp, all spell slots, anything defined when creating your character, and all spent hit dice.</p>

		<h2>Interacting with Other Characters</h2>
		<p>Lots of things come into play when interacting with other characters and npcs in dnd. Rember that you aren't playing yourself so try to think about interactions from your characters point 
		of view, your character probably won't get along with everyone, and that's okay. Your character's alignment and background are the biggest factors when interacting with people. Someone who is chatoic 
		usually doesn't like being ordered to do something whereas someone lawful, won't enjoy talking to nefarious people. If your character was a hermit they might be super bad at talking to people, or 
		if your character is a charismatic bard they are probably great at it. Think about how your character would feel about the conversation and act the way they would. Of course there is a line where you 
		know that you are trying to accomplish your quest and if your character would be incredibly unhelpful try not to make life to hard for your DM while staying true to your character. Your DM should do a good 
		job of setting the scene, while you and your party need to act the scene out. To do certain things your DM may ask you to roll an ability check. Things like convincing someone to give you info may be a 
		persuasion check. For an ability check you roll your d20 and add the bonus listed next to the ability on your character sheet. Sometimes though, if your roleplaying is up to snuff your DM might let you do 
		something without the ability check.</p>
		
			<hr></hr>
		<h2>Note Taking</h2>
		<p>While playing a typical campaign your character will meet lots of people and see lots of sights. Many of which will likely matter in the future of your campaign so it is highly suggested that you take notes
		whilte playing. I have a folder with my character sheets and notes for when I go to play dnd. It is best to keep lots of blank paper, because depending on your group's and DM's play your 
		character may have to solve puzzles and have to draw maps to get through mazes. Generally you should be clued in on who and what is important, and as long as you aren't the only player taking notes 
		your party will be fine. Ask other players in your group if you aren't sure when and what to write down. I always try to write down as much as possible while playing.</p>
			<hr></hr>
			
		<h2>General Tips</h2> 
		<p>All you really need to do is have fun, losen up and let the story you are creating lead you. Don't worry about the extensive amount of rules t the game, they will start to come naturaly to you 
		and if it isn't your thing. That's okay to. Dnd isn't for everyone, but can be a lot of fun if you let yourself get into it. My best advise it to let go and have faith it will all work out.</p>
