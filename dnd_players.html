	<h2>Friends and Acquaintances</h2>
	<p>As duengons and dragon(dnd) has been increasing in popularity in recent years due to shows like Stranger Things it has become easier and easier to find 
	people who want to play. The best first step is keeping your ears open and looking around your life for other dnd players. Tell you friends
	about you new interest in it, and it is quite likly that at least one person you know already plays, or might have a connection to someone who 
	does.</p>
	
	<h2>Comic Book Shops</h2>
	<p>Another great place to look for people to play with is comic book stores. Many comic book shops have dnd nights where employees or friends of 
	the store DM for anyone that shows up. Search your local area and see if one of your comic book stores does this. Comic book stores tend to run premade 
	campaigns which are great for new players, but if you play long enough you may have to do the same campaign more than once. I recommend going to find people
	to make a group and play with once you all start to understand the game.</p>
	
	<h2>Online</h2>
	<p>Another great thing is that you can play dnd online for free, and the internet is also a great place to look for players in you area. Here is a link to 
	<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/intro?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhZr1BRCLARIsALjRVQMOCPgC_BPgfiBaDkkqAsls7OvUwwF_lRxVgnewk-9G1qSsrCSHhDQaAqXaEALw_wcB"> Dnd Beyond</a> it 
	is the offical online dnd website. Another site I found is called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/topics/dnd/"> Meetup</a> it will connect you to dnd groups all 
	around the world. (Click the back arrow to return to this website)</p>
