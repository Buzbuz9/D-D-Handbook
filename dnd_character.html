		<h1 id="race"><strong>Race</strong></h1>
		</div>
		<p>So there are 9 basic races in duengons and dragons(dnd). There are many other homebrew races, but you will need other sources to look into them, and I recomend
		a new player start with one of the basic 9 to get the hang of it. All of the base races are humanoid, and there are many things that distinguish
		each race and give it advantageous and disadvantageous during the game. The main components are called racial traits. They include: ability score
		increase, age, alignment, size, speed, languages, and some races have subraces. But first things first when creating a character you need to use a 
		character creation sheet. <a href="charSheet.pdf">Click here for the sheet.</a> I recommend printing it out and writing it by hand(in pencil) or editing it in a pdf software.</p>
		
		<h2>Alignment</h2>
		<p>A great place to start when making a character is alignment. Alignment is how your character behaves. There are nine alignment possibilities see the
		table below for them all. Now just reading that you are probably at least a bit confused. So let me explain what each of these alignments means. See below the
		chart for explanations, but remmeber that dnd is a role-playing game and you can twerk just about any alignment to work for your character.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Lawful Good</dt>
			<dd>This is the basic hero of the story good sameritain type character. They want to help the good guys, and save the day Think Superman.</dd>
			
			<dt>Neutral Good</dt>
			<dd>This is similar to Lawful Good but they have a lesser sense of morals, and just kinda want to help people. That means they may end up helping 
			the bad guys. They want to keep the balance of the universe more than do "good", and they don't really care if they follow the law or not. 
			Think Tyrion Lannister. </dd>
			
			<dt>Chaotic Good</dt>
			<dd>This is someone who has good intentions but either doesn't understand the law, or blantantly ignores it. They probably do there best but make lots 
			of mistakes and mess many things up. Think Batman, Castiel, or Captin Jack Sparrow.</dd>
			
			<dt>Lawful Neutral</dt>
			<dd>This is someone who doesn't really care about others, but doesn't want to get into trouble. They could also simply have a moral standard that comes before all else. 
			Think C3PO(his code is his morals) or Indiana Jones(it doesn't matter if it's stealing it belongs in a meseum).</dd>
			
			<dt>Neutral Neutral</dt>
			<dd>This is someone who doesn't really have distinct morals or a code. They don't really care about the general good or the rules. They also could be someone obsessed with the balance in the universe,
			or someone that lives on pure instinct. Think Cat-Women or Cheshire Cat. </dd>
			
			<dt>Chaotic Neutral</dt>
			<dd>This is simply someone unpredictable. They are driven by nothing but there own desires. Think Boba Fett or Gollum.</dd>
			
			<dt>Lawful Evil</dt>
			<dd>This is someone evil but within the constraints of the law. They are perfectly fine until they don't like, then they will hunt you till the ends of the Earth.
			Think politicians, lawyers, and the Inquisition.</dd>
			
			<dt>Neutral Evil</dt>
			<dd>This is someone who would stab you in the back to gain something as long as they could get away with it. Good leaders, but you typically don't want them in your party.
			Think Deadpool.</dd>
			
			<dt>Chaotic Evil</dt>
			<dd>This is someone who simply wants to watch the world burn. A truly crazy and evil villain. Think the Joker.</dd>

		<h2 class="race">Halfling</h2>
		<img src="halfing.png" alt="halfing" class="race" />
			<p class="race">The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. 
			Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples.
			But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.</p>
			<p>Bonuses: Dexterity +2, you are lucky if you roll a 1 on an attack ability check or saving throw you can reroll and you must use the new roll, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, and you can move through a space occupied by a creature at least 1 size larger than you.</p>

		<img src="human.png" alt="human" class="race" />

			Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</p>
			<p>Bonuses: ability scores +1, languages: common +1 of choice</p>
			
		
		
		<h2 class="race">Dragonborn</h2>
		<img src="dragonborn.jpg" alt="dragonborn" class="race" />
			<p class="race">Dragonborn resemble humanoid dragons. They're covered in scaly hide, but they don't have tails. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet in height and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet 
			are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p>

		<img src="half-elf.jpg" alt="half-elf" class="race" />
			<p class="race">Half-elves, as their name implies, are the offspring of humans and elves. ... Half-Elves have curiosity and ambitions like humans but they have a sense for magic and love for nature like their elven parents. Their skin is paler 
			than human skin and they are taller and bigger than elves.</p>

		<img src="tiefling.png" alt="teifling" class="race" />
			<p class="race">To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is a lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact 
			struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their faults but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and 
			their children’s children will always be held accountable.</p>
			<p>Bonuses: Intelligence +1, Charisma +2, darkvision(60ft), resistance to fire damage, know thaumaturgy cantrip, at 3rd level can cast hellish rebuke, and languages: common and Infernal.</p>

			<h3>Acolyte</h3>
				<p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, 
				performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not 
				the same thing as channeling divine power. Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious 
				service. The Gods of the Multiverse section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood
				to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a 
				small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. </p>
				<ul>Bonuses
					<li>Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion</li>
					<li>Languages: Two of your choice</li>
					<li>Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and 
					a pouch containing 15 gp.</li>
					<li>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful <p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to 
					receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) 
					at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms 
					with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</p> </li>
				</ul>
				
				<img src="dndLogoRed.jpg" alt="D&D Logo" id="logo"/>
				
			<h3>Charlatan</h3>
				<p>You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a
				few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage.
				You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true,
				but common sense seem s to be in short supply when you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment—nothing
				more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust—can restore youth and vigor, and there’s a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound
				implausible, but you make them sound like the real deal.</p>
				<ul>Bonuses

					<li>Feature: False Identity <p>You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official 
					papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind</p> </li>
				</ul>
				
			<img src="dndLogoRed.jpg" alt="D&D Logo" id="logo"/>
				
			<h3>Criminal</h3>
				<p>You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You're far closer than most people to the world of murder, 
				theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.</p>

					you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.</p> </li>

					<li>Feature: By Popular Demand <p>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest 
					or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, 
					they typically take a liking to you.</p> </li>
				</ul>
				
			<img src="dndLogoRed.jpg" alt="D&D Logo" id="logo"/>
			
			<h3>Folk Hero</h3>

					you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.</p> </li>
				</ul>
			
			<img src="dndLogoRed.jpg" alt="D&D Logo" id="logo"/>
			
			<h3>Guild Artisan</h3>
				<p> You are a member of an artisan's guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice 
				to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own right.</p>
				<ul>Bonuses
					<li>Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion</li>
					<li>Languages: One of your choice</li>
					<li>Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools</li>
					<li>Equipment: A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>
					<li>Feature: Guild Membership <p>As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a 
					guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings. Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for
					your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to 
					the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.</p> </li>
				</ul>
				
			<img src="dndLogoRed.jpg" alt="D&D Logo" id="logo"/>
			
			<h3>Hermit</h3>
				<p> You lived in seclusion – either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.</p>
				<ul>Bonuses

					<li>Equipment: A scroll case stuffed full of notes from your studies or prayers, a winter blanket, a set of common clothes, an herbalism kit, and 5 gp</li>
					<li>Feature: Discovery <p>The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer 
					planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you 
					to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.</p> </li>
				</ul>
				
			<img src="dndLogoRed.jpg" alt="D&D Logo" id="logo"/>
			
			<h3>Nobel</h3>
				<p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited 
				scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>

					other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p> </li>

			<img src="dndLogoRed.jpg" alt="D&D Logo" id="logo"/>
			
			<h3>Outlander</h3>
				<p>You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in 
				any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.</p>

		<h2>Rolling for Stats</h2>
			<p>This is one of the most crucial steps in creating your character. Take a d20 and roll it 6 times write down the value of every roll. Depending on what class you choose you
			can see above which stat to assign the highest rolls to. After that the rest is up to who your want you character to be. The lower the roll the worse they will be in that area. 
			A 10 is considered average and a 15+ is considered great. If you first set of rolls is really awful you can reroll once more but you must use the second set of number regarless 
			of if they are better or worse. Don't worry if you get a really low number or 2 I once had a character with a 4 in strength my character was so weak I frequently wasn't strong 
			enough to climb up the ladder by myself. If you roll a 1 or a 2 you do get to reroll that die once.</p>
		<h2>Background Details and Personality</h2>
			<p>My group and I are all fairly invested in the role play aspect of dnd and tend to write our own original backstories for each of our characters.
			I recommend talking to your DM and group to be able to connect your character’s back story to others and the main plot of some of your campaigns. It can 
			make the game more worthwhile and fun.</p>
		
		<h2>Character Details</h2>
			<p>There are presets/examples for personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds for every background, but it can be a lot more fun to come up with your owns.</p>
			<h3>Personality Traits</h3>
				<p>Personality traits are small simple ways to help set your character apart from everyone else. Your personality trait should tell you something interesting and fun about your
				character. They should be specific about what makes your character stand out. Nothing too generic.  Ex. "I'm smart" isn't good instead try something like "I have read every book in 
				Candlekeep" it tells you something specific about your character's disposition. A personality trait can describe things your character likes, their accomplishments, things they fear, 
				things they dislike or your character's attitude and mannerisms. Write at least two down for your character.</p>
			<h3>Ideals</h3>
				<p>Ideals are the things that your character believes in the most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel your character to act as they do. Ideals
				encompass everything from your character's life goals to your core belief system. A good place to start when choosing ideals is your character's alignment</p>
			<h3>Bonds</h3>
				<p>Bonds represent a character’s connection to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things and people from your background. They might inspire you to acts of villainy or heroism 
				or they may make you work against your own best interest. They help drive your character’s motivation and goals. They are who you care about most, and what you favorite places to be are</p>
			<h3>Flaws</h3>
				<p>Your character’s flaws represent some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness(something that someone else could exploit). It should be more significant than negative personality traits.</p>

		<h2>Feats</h2>
			<p>Feats represent an area of skill or talent your character has. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. Feats are optional so ask your group and DM about them.
			From page 165-170 in the <a href="dnd_handbook.pdf">PHB</a> you can find a list of all the feat and what bonuses they give you.</p>
		<h2>Naming your Character</h2>
	   <p>Naming our character can be the hardest part of creating them. I always struggle, but you have a name in mind by this point go with that. If you get 
	   stuck <a href="https://www.wizards.com/dnd/article5.asp?x=dnd/dx20010202b,0">here </a> is a good source for inspiration or just getting a name. (Click the back arrow to return to this website)</p>

		<h2>Armor and Shields</h2>
			<p>There are three types of armor: light, medium, and heavy. </p>
			<h3>Light Armor</h3>
			<p>Made from supple and thin materials, Light Armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear Light Armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base
			number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. There are three types of light armor padded, leather, and studded leather. Padded: Padded Armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.
			Leather: The Breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials. 
			Studded Leather: Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p>
			<h3>Medium Armor</h3>
			<p>Medium Armor offers more Protection than Light Armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear Medium Armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type 
			to determine your Armor Class. There are five types of medium armor hide, chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, and half plate. Hid⁠e: This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by Barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, 
			and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor. Chain⁠ S⁠hirt: Made of interlocking metal rings, a Chain Shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper 
			body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers. Scale M⁠ail: This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces 
			of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets. Breastp⁠late: This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this 
			armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered. Half⁠ Plate: Half Plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include 
			leg Protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p>
			<h3>Heavey Armor</h3>
			<p>Of all the armor categories, Heavy Armor offers the best Protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage 
			their weight and bulk. Heavy Armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative. There are four types of heavy armor: ring mail, 
			chain mail, splint, and plate. Ring⁠ Mail: This armor is Leather Armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from Swords and axes. Ring Mail is inferior to Chain Mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor.
			 Chain⁠ Mail: Made of interlocking metal rings, Chain Mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets. Splint: This armor is made of narrow vertical 
			 strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible Chain Mail protects the joints. Plate: Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate 
			 includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.</p>
			
		<h2>Weapons</h2>
			<p>The most important things to consider about choosing a weapon is the type of damge it does. There are thirteen damage types: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, and 
			thunder. Different types of attacks and weapons will do different types of damage. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Slashing: Imagine this as any type of cut, gash, or – if you’re feeling extra fancy – laceration.</li>
				<li>Bludgeoning: Straight up just getting smacked hard by something.</li>
				<li>Poison:  A toxic substance that is “ingested” and causes harm to the body.</li>
				<li>Acid: An excess of H+ ions in a solution. This causes intense burning and stinging and can corrode through certain materials if strong enough.</li>
				<li>Fire: Hot and painful</li>
				<li>Cold: Frigid pain leading to potential numbness caused by temperatures approaching zero Kelvin.</li>
				<li>Radiant:  A divine smiting from the highest heavens. I typically think of how the sun sears the skin of a vampire.</li>
				<li>Necrotic: I think of this as the destruction of ‘life force’. Death, decay, rotting, and corruption. Smells like the geriatrics ward.</li>
				<li>Lightning:  Lightning damage is caused by a high voltage of electricity (approx. 1.21 jiggawatts).</li>
				<li>Thunder: Percussive noise that is loud enough to cause damage. It’s like standing next to the speaker at a concert.</li>
				<li>Force: A raw form of magical energy that hits targets like a brick wall.</li>
				<li>Psychic: Telepathic abilities inflicting massive damage to the mind.</li>
				<li>Piercing: Being poked by a sharp object.</li>
